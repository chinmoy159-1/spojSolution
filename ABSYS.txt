/*
* Jimmy is a hard-working pupil in his second year at primary school.
* Recently he decided to convert all his notes into an electronic version.
* Sadly, he found that his math notes were full of ink blots.
* He scanned the notes and sent them through his own OCR package
* (yes, he coded it all by himself at the age of 8).
* The OCR package replaced all ink blots by the string "machula".
* You are given Jimmy's notes, processed by the OCR.
* They contain simple math exercises, which were used to practice addition on positive integers.
* Your task is to recover the damaged part of the notes.
*
* Input: -
* The first line of the input file contains an integer T specifying the number of test cases.
* Each test case is preceded by a blank line.
* Each test case consists of exactly one line.
* The line represents an equation of the form "number + number = number",
* where each number is a positive integer.
* One part of the equation will be replaced by the string "machula".
* The string always covers a contiguous non-empty sequence of digits, possibly even an entire number.
* You may assume that for each equation in the input there will be exactly one way to fill in the missing digits.
*
* Output: -
* For each test case, the output shall contain one line of the form "number + number = number".
* The line must represent the equation from that test case with all missing digits filled in.
