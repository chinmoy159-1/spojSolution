/* *
* Pappu was doing the work of his math class about three days,
* but he is tired of make operations a lot and he should deliver his task tomorrow.
* His mathâ€™s teacher gives two numbers a and b.
* The problem consist in find the last digit of the potency of base a and index b.
* Help Pappu with his problem. You are given two integer numbers: the base a (number of digits d, such that 1<=d<=1000)
* and the index b (0 <= b <= 922*10^15). You have to find the last digit of a^b.
*
* Input: -
* The first line of input contains an integer t, the number of test cases (t <= 30). t test cases follow.
* For each test case will appear a and b separated by space.
*
* Output: -
* For each test case output an integer per line representing the result.
