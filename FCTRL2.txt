/* *
* You are asked to calculate factorials of some small positive integers.
*
* Input: -
* An integer t, 1<=t<=100, denoting the number of testcases, followed by t lines, each containing a single integer n, 1<=n<=100.
*
* Output: -
* For each integer n given at input, display a line with the value of n!
