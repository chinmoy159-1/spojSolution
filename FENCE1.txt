/* *
* There is a wall in your backyard.
* It is so long that you can’t see its endpoints.
* You want to build a fence of length L such that the area enclosed between the wall and the fence is maximized.
* The fence can be of arbitrary shape, but only its two endpoints may touch the wall.
*
* Input: -
*
* The input consists of several test cases.
* For every test case, there is only one integer L (1<=L<=100),
* indicating the length of the fence.
* The input ends with L=0.
*
* Output: -
* For each test case, output one line containing the largest area.
* Your answer should be rounded to 2 digits after the decimal point.
