/* *
* Check Wikipedia for any details on AP and GP.
* For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, . . . is a geometric progression with common ratio 3.
* For this problem, we will limit ourselves to geometric progression whose common ratio is a non-zero integer.
* Given three successive members of a sequence, you need to determine the type of the progression and the next successive member.
*
* Input:-
* Your program will be tested on one or more test cases.
* Each case is specified on a single line with three integers (-10, 000 < a1 , a2 , a3 < 10, 000) where a1 , a2 , and a3 are distinct.
* The last case is followed by a line with three zeros.
*
* Output:-
* For each test case, you program must print a single line of the form:
* XX v
* where XX is either AP or GP depending if the given progression is an Arithmetic or Geometric Progression,
* v is the next member of the given sequence. All input cases are guaranteed to be either an arithmetic or geometric progressions.
