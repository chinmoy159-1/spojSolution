/* *
* Byteman has a collection of N squares with side 1. How many different rectangles can he form using these squares?
* Two rectangles are considered different if none of them can be rotated and moved to obtain the second one.
* During rectangle construction, Byteman can neither deform the squares nor put any squares upon any other ones.
*
* Input:-
* The first and only line of the standard input contains one integer N (1 < N < 10000).
*
* Output:-
* The first and only line of the standard output should contain a single integer equal to the number of different rectangles that Byteman can form using his squares.
