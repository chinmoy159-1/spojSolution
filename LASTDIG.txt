/* *
* Nestor was doing the work of his math class about three days but he is tired of make operations a lot and he should deliver his task tomorrow.
* His mathâ€™s teacher gives two numbers a and b. The problem consist in find the last digit of the potency of base a and index b.
* Help Nestor with his problem. You are given two integer numbers: the base a (0 <= a <= 20) and the index b (0 <= b <= 2,147,483,000),
* a and b both are not 0. You have to find the last digit of a^b.
*
* Input: -
* The first line of input contains an integer t, the number of test cases (t <= 30).
* t test cases follow. For each test case will appear a and b separated by space.
*
* Output: -
* For each test case output an integer per line representing the result.
