/* *
* Arithmatic and geometric Progressions are 2 of the well known progressions in maths.
* Arithmatic progression(AP) is a set in which the difference between 2 numbers in constant. for eg, 1,3,5,7,9 .... In this series the difference between 2 numbers is 2.
* The task here is very simple indeed.
* You will be given the 3rd term , 3rd last term and the sum of the series. You need print length of the series & the series.
*
* Input:-
* First line will contain a number indicating the number of test cases.
* Each of the following t lines will have 3 number '3term' ,'3Lastterm' and 'sum'
* 3rd term  - is the 3rd term in of the series and
* 3rd Lastterm  - is the 3rd term in of the series and
* Sum - is the sum of the series.
*
* Output:-
* For each input of the test case, you need to print 2 lines.
* 1st line should have 1 value- number of terms in the series.
* 2nd line of the output should print the series numbers separated by single space.
