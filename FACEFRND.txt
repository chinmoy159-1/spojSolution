/* *
* Bob uses a social networking site almost all the time. He was wondering what are Friends of Friends in that social networking site?
* If “X” is his friend, and “Y” is X’s friend but “Y” is not his friend, then “Y” is called his friend of friend.
* You have to find how many friends of friends Bob has. (Each user in that social networking site has a unique 4-digit ID number)
*
* Input:-
* First line contains a integer “N” (1<=N<=100) the number of friends in Bob's Profile. Then follow N lines.
* First Integer in each line is the ID number of Bob's friend, then an integer “M” (1<=M<=100) is the number of people in his friend list.
* Then follow M integers in that line, denoting the ID number of friends in his friend list (excluding Bob). 
*
